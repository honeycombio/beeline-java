/**
 * The Beeline class is the main/most-convenient point of interaction with traces in a Beeline-instrumented application.
 * It allows user code to {@linkplain Span#addField(String, Object) add contextual information} to the currently active
 * Span and {@linkplain #startChildSpan(String) to create new nested/child Spans}. This is done by interacting with
 * internal thread-local context. In essence, creating a child pushes onto a stack and {@linkplain Span#close()
 * closing the span} pops it back off. <em>Take care to always close the Spans you create</em> to ensure correct
 * measurements of duration and timely submission to Honeycomb.
 *
 * <h1>Instrumentation</h1>
 * When using this class, it is assumed that your framework instrumentation would have initialized an initial "root"
 * Span, alleviating the burden of having to manage low-level details.
 * For example, the <b>Spring Beeline</b> creates a "root" span for all incoming HTTP requests and closes it when the
 * request returns from user code.
 * <p>
 * However, access to the low level API is given via the delegates returned by {@link #getTracer()} and
 * {@link #getSpanBuilderFactory()}. The Beeline class is essentially a fa√ßade to those delegates,
 * narrowing and bundling lower-level APIs to target the most common use-cases.
 *
 * <h1>Sampling</h1>
 * Sampling of traces and Spans can be done in two ways.
 * <p>
 * Firstly, the {@link SpanBuilderFactory} is configured with a "global" sampler
 * (usually {@link DeterministicTraceSampler} that applies its sampling logic to a Span's {@code traceId},
 * and therefore will sample uniformly with a specific sample rate.
 * In addition, if a trace is not sampled, "noop" spans that carry no data are generated tp minimise runtime overhead.
 * <p>
 * Secondly, the factory can be configure with a {@link SpanPostProcessor} that applies sampling just before a Span is
 * submitted to Honeycomb. This allows sampling to be performed based on the contents of the Span.
 * <b>It does so only on Spans that have been sampled by the "global" sampler, because "noop" Spans carry no data</b>.
 * <p>
 * For example, you might decide to sample Spans containing fields indicating error conditions at a high rate,
 * and sample the "happy path" at a lower rate.
 * <p>
 * When the two sampling mechanisms are used together then the effective sample rate is a product of both.
 * However, note that you do not have to use either of the sampling mechanisms and can always configure either one or
 * both to "always sample" with a {@code sampleRate} of 1 (e.g. {@link Sampling#alwaysSampler()} does this).
 *
 * <h1>Thread-safety</h1>
 * See {@link Tracer Tracer's notes on thread-safety}, as the same rules apply to this class.
 *
 * <h1>Propagation to other threads</h1>
 * Because of the use of thread-local context you might find traces breaking as you execute code asynchronously.
 * <p>
 * See {@link Tracer the Tracer's notes on propagation}, which details how to use its API to propagate your traces to
 * other threads.
 *
 * <h1>Propagation to other processes</h1>
 * For example, the <b>Spring Beeline</b> automatically accepts traces by decoding the Honeycomb trace header.
 * It also continues traces downstream when using Spring's RestTemplate.
 * <p>
 * If your framework instrumentation does not automatically propagate traces then you can use
 * {@link Propagation#honeycombHeaderV1()} to encode/decode Honeycombs standard HTTP header.
 * Once decoded, you can use the {@link SpanBuilderFactory} to create new instance and {@link Tracer#startTrace(Span)}
 * to initialize the "root" Span.
 * <p>
 * Encoding takes a {@link PropagationContext}, which you can retrieve with {@link Span#getTraceContext()}.
